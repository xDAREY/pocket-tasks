## Architecture
# State Management
This app uses Riverpod for state management, chosen for its:

Compile-time safety
Better testing capabilities
Excellent provider composition
Built-in caching and automatic disposal

## Project Structure
lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ main.dart                 # App entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ models/                   # Data models
â”œâ”€â”€ providers/                # Riverpod providers
â”œâ”€â”€ screens/                  # UI screens
â”œâ”€â”€ widgets/                  # Reusable widgets

â””â”€â”€ utils/                    # Utilities and themes

## Key Design Decisions

1. Hive for Local Storage: Chosen for its performance and ease of use with custom objects
2. Material Design 3: Modern UI following Google's latest design guidelines
Provider Pattern: Clean separation of business logic from UI
Modular Architecture: Easy to maintain and extend
